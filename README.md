This project involves a scratch implementation of k-nearest neighbor  classifier, accompanied by small data analysis and a comparison with existing method in scikit-learn. I applied this method over the wine classifier dataset provided by sklearn. Additionally, the analysis explores the grades of accuracy for different k.

It is possible to see the full analysis in a notion report in the following https://discreet-book-31a.notion.site/K-nearest-neighbor-classifier-11cbef23a79280be929decf62505fa0a?pvs=4
